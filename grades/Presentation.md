OOSE Project Overview Presentation Evaluation
---------------------------------------------
**Group: 13**

### Attendance: anyone missing?
Everyone present


### Overview of project: clearly explained and understandable?
PlanIt is an Itinerary Manager.
Most important feature is the recommendation algorithm.
Trying to fit the experience to the tastes of the user. For example, do they prefer small stores or big chains?

### Demo: clear?
Demo worked on iOS. But was barely displaying any of the core feature.
They have not started working on said algorithm. This is a red flag.

### Architecture explained? General structure of code at this point explained?
iOS on the front-end. Flask on the back-end.
Their focus is on the algorithm on the backend.

### Presentation organization, both in terms of logistics and quality of slides, properly taking turns, demo going smoothly, etc.
The first slide was a big blob of text. Avoid it.
Say what you need to do (e.g., grocery shopping), the application finds the optimal way of doing it.
Text on UML diagram too small.


### Project comments we noticed during presentation:
You need to get the algorithm part working. All other core features revolve around this. For simplicity try and get a simple thing working and integrate this with all other aspects.
