# Iteration 1 Evaluation - Group 13

**Evaluator: Nikhil (mailto:nkulkar7@jhu.edu)**



## Positive Points:

* Your UML diagram is neat and clear. 
* You have understood UML concepts quite well and have used components well.


## Things to Improve:

### Basic features

* What exactly is the purpose of the app? It was difficult to tell

*(-2 points)*

* How exactly are recommendations being made? Are you just plugging into
  Google? What is the "smart algorithm?" (this needs to be detailed to meet
  project requirements) It appears that all other features can be implemented
  with simple database queries

*(-5 points)*

### UI Sketches

Your goal mentions:

> Our goal is to also form a way to connect with friends with ease by sharing itineraries with each other and find places to go based on friendâ€™s ratings.

This feature is not evident from the UI sketches.

*(-5 point)*

### Use Cases

* What makes this interesting? It looks like just a fancy calendar.

*(-2 point)*


## Suggestions:

* One of the features you can implement by reading the event details.
* You can identify key words from the detailed text to identify key places.

## Overall:

* A good start.It seems that you are trying to do a lot of things together. Even after implemeting all of these things, the app will still be a fancy calendar. Try to get rid of trivial features which will take a lot of time to implement.
