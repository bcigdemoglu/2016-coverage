Machine Learning overview

Display Suggestion Algorithm Parameters:

Initial Parameters(No learning/training)
Time
Location
Global Yelp Rating
All of Planit User's Ratings of Place/Venue (as we accumulate them), given time and location constraints
Friends user ratings of Place/venue
Previous ratings of the Venue from that user

Training Parameter:
Personal Rating of event


Ordering Algorithm:
Premise:  We want to have better suggestions tailored to what the user selects.  
Thus, we will learn about what factors lead each user to select a Place.

Implementation has not started yet, but will be building according to this page.
We will have the Suggestion Algorithm use a Cost function, in which each User will have a set of values 
that correspond to the Initial Parameters, and how much they (hopefully positively) impact the User's experience.  
We may go a step further in granularity and include all these values per user, per Venue (clearly the previous ratings 
that Venue will be on a per venue basis)
Most of our algorithm will have already done the selecting before the previos ratings of Venues is even considered,
as this pears down the total amount of suggestions to consider the per venue rating

The algorithm will not only determine the ranking, but also give a numerical expression to display on the UI in the form of stars

This part of the algorithm will be assisted by a similar one that is for the global set of users with the same values,
to make sure that we don't get too fine with our predictions.

Choice Algorithm
Also, we want to be able to make sure that the user chooses the event that we think they will enjoy the most.  
So, we will play with the ordering on the UI of the suggestions, learning more about where each user (and the global set of users)
tend to select the most (Is it about stars or the position on the screen?)
